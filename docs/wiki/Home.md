## ✨ What is EverShelf?

EverShelf is a **self-hosted pantry management system** that runs entirely on your own server. It:

- Tracks food inventory across multiple storage locations (pantry, fridge, freezer, custom)
- Scans barcodes and uses **Google Gemini AI** to identify products from photos
- Suggests recipes based on what's in your pantry — especially items about to expire
- Predicts what you'll need to buy before you run out
- Integrates with the **Bring!** shopping list app
- Supports a **BLE smart scale** for weight-based tracking
- Runs as a **Progressive Web App** installable on any device
- Optionally pairs with a dedicated **Android kiosk tablet app**

All data stays on your server. No cloud, no subscriptions.

## 🆕 What's New

### v1.7.13 (2026-05-16)
- **Critical fix:** Fresh-install crash resolved — `transactions` schema was missing the `undone` column, causing a database failure on every new installation
- **Fix:** Race condition in DB migrations no longer causes `duplicate column name` errors on concurrent first requests

### v1.7.12 (2026-05-13)
- "Use first" banner now shows opening date and location instead of a confusing calculated expiry
- "Use All / Done" in recipes no longer deletes the inventory row — uses exact quantity instead
- Scan page fully redesigned: 2× zoom, torch, camera flip, 3 input tabs, AI Number OCR, recent products chips
- Anomaly detection: false positives eliminated (untracked direction removed, minimum 5 txn + 7-day span)
- AI price estimation for each Bring! shopping item with real-time dashboard total badge
- Kiosk v1.6.0: BLE scale gateway is now built-in — no separate APK needed
- Complete i18n: 934 keys per language
