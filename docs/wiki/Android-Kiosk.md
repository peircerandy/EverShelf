## Download

**[⬇ Download latest APK](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/releases/latest/download/evershelf-kiosk.apk)**

> Current version: **v1.6.0** — requires Android 7.0+

---

## What it does

- Displays the EverShelf web app in a **full-screen WebView** (no browser chrome)
- **Locks the screen** with Android's `startLockTask` — home, recents, and back buttons are blocked
- Runs the **built-in BLE scale gateway** as an integrated foreground service — no external app required
- Provides a **native TTS bridge** so Cooking Mode reads steps aloud via Android TextToSpeech
- Auto-detects your EverShelf server on the LAN with a **smart discovery scanner**
- Reports errors and install failures back to the developer automatically

## Setup Wizard (6 steps)

The wizard runs automatically on first launch.

### Step 1 — Language
Select the app and web interface language (Italian, English, German).

### Step 2 — Welcome
Overview of what the wizard will configure.

### Step 3 — Permissions
Grant camera, microphone, and storage permissions needed by the web app.

The button transforms from "Concedi permessi" to **"✅ Permessi concessi — Continua →"** (green) once all permissions are granted.

### Step 4 — Server URL
Enter your EverShelf server URL (e.g. `https://192.168.1.100/dispensa`).

**Or tap "Rileva automaticamente"** to let the wizard scan your LAN:
- 60 parallel threads, TCP pre-check, ports 80/443/8080/8443
- Only scans your actual Wi-Fi/Ethernet subnet (VPN and cellular interfaces ignored)
- Real-time feedback as hosts are tested

### Step 5 — Smart Scale
If you have a Bluetooth LE smart scale, configure it here:
1. Tap **"Yes, I have a scale"** — the app scans for nearby BLE devices
2. Tap your scale in the list (devices most likely to be scales are marked with ⭐)
3. On selection, the app automatically writes `scale_enabled=true` and `scale_gateway_url=ws://127.0.0.1:8765` to your EverShelf server

The BLE gateway runs as a built-in foreground service — **no external APK needed**.

### Step 6 — Screensaver
Choose whether the screen should go dark after inactivity.

### Summary
All done — the web app loads in full-screen kiosk mode.

---

## Exiting Kiosk Mode

Tap the **✕** button in the header (top-left). A confirmation dialog appears.

---

## Hard Refresh

Tap the **↻** button in the header to clear the WebView cache and reload the latest version of the web app.

---

## Update Notifications

Every 6 hours the app checks GitHub releases. If a newer version is available, a banner appears with a one-tap download and install flow.

---

## Native TTS Bridge

When Cooking Mode reads recipe steps, the kiosk app:
1. Intercepts the TTS call from the web app via a JavaScript bridge
2. Uses the Android `TextToSpeech` engine directly
3. Falls back to the browser Web Speech API if the bridge is unavailable

No internet connection required for TTS. No extra voice packs to install.

---

## SSL / Self-signed Certificates

The WebView accepts self-signed certificates automatically. No configuration needed for local HTTPS servers.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Server non trovato" during auto-discovery
- Make sure your tablet and server are on the same Wi-Fi network
- Ensure the server is not on a VPN-only interface
- Try entering the URL manually

### Screen pinning / back button not working
- Screen pinning requires the app to be set as Device Owner or the user to confirm the pin prompt
- Some Android skins (Samsung, Xiaomi) may require additional accessibility permissions

### App crashes on startup
- Force-stop the app, clear its data (Settings → Apps → EverShelf Kiosk → Clear data), and relaunch
