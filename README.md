## 🌍 Recent Updates (v1.7.11)

- **Scan page redesign** — La pagina di scansione è stata completamente ridisegnata: **2× zoom fisso** (hardware o CSS), **torcia** con feedback visivo, **flip fotocamera** (front/back), **3 tab input** (Barcode / Nome / AI), **prodotti recenti** (ultimi 6 in localStorage), **live code overlay** durante la scansione parziale, **confirm overlay** al successo, **angoli guida** nel viewport.
- **AI Number OCR** — Dopo 4 secondi senza scansione compare il bottone "Leggi numeri con AI": Gemini analizza il frame video e restituisce le cifre del barcode anche quando lo scanner ottico non riesce a leggerlo.
- **Fix falsi positivi anomalie** — Rimossa la direzione `untracked` dal rilevatore di anomalie; le predizioni di consumo richiedono ora min 5 transazioni e 7 giorni di storico.
- **Fix menu suggerimenti scan** — Rimosso il datalist dal campo Nome nella pagina scansione (non più aperto su tablet).
- **Fix falsi positivi anomalie consumo** — `getConsumptionPredictions` richiedeva solo 3 transazioni, potendo generare rate esplose su dati ravvicinati. Ora: min 5 txn, min 7gg span, skip se consumo predetto < 15% baseline.

- **Banner "Imposta scadenza" ora funziona** — Il pulsante sul banner "nessuna scadenza" apriva una funzione inesistente. Corretto, ora apre correttamente la modal di modifica.
- **Banner aperto vs scaduto** — I prodotti con `opened_at` mostrano "Aperto da N giorni in [posizione]" invece di "Scaduto!", con la posizione (frigo/dispensa/freezer) esplicitamente indicata.
- **Shelf life latte UHT** — Il latte generico è ora trattato come UHT (7 giorni dopo apertura) invece che fresco (4 giorni).
- **Niente più false anomalie di consumo** — Il rilevatore ora ignora i casi in cui `expected = 0` (prodotto probabilmente ricomprato) e alza la soglia "more than expected" al 400%. Le notifiche rimangono solo per consumi significativamente inferiori al previsto.
- **Scaduti nascondono prodotti già buttati** — La sezione scaduti ora filtra correttamente i prodotti con `quantity = 0`.
- **Docker: fix permessi DB al primo avvio** — `_ensureDataDir()` crea la directory `data/` se mancante e tenta `chmod(0775)` se non scrivibile, risolvendo `SQLSTATE[HY000][14]` su volumi Docker freschi.
- **AI price estimation for shopping list** — Each Bring! shopping item now shows an estimated retail price badge (unit price + total). Prices are fetched via Gemini AI, cached server-side for 3 months, and stored client-side in `sessionStorage` to survive navigation. The dashboard shopping stat card shows a live green `ca. €X.XX` badge that updates in real-time as prices are calculated — even in background when you're on another tab.
- **Kiosk v1.7.0: OTA update system** — "Cerca aggiornamenti" button in Settings triggers a forced GitHub release check; new `installUpdate()` JS bridge calls Android `DownloadManager` directly (lockTask mode blocks external browser links); graceful degradation for older APKs with manual instructions. Automatic OTA check every 6 hours with native update banner.
- **Kiosk: consistent APK signing** — Project keystore (`evershelf.jks`) committed to the repo; every build — local or CI — now produces an APK with the same signature, eliminating "APK incompatible / signature conflict" errors on OTA update.
- **GitHub Actions: auto-publish kiosk APK** — On every push to `main` that touches `evershelf-kiosk/`, Actions builds the APK and publishes a versioned semver release (`kiosk-X.Y.Z`) plus updates the `kiosk-latest` alias. No more manual release uploads.
- **Fix: false "update available" on launch** — `checkForUpdates` now requires a strictly-greater semver tag to flag an update. Non-semver tags (e.g. `kiosk-latest`) no longer trigger a false positive immediately after a fresh install.
- **Kiosk: live scale diagnostic panel** — When connected, Settings shows device name, battery %, real-time weight, protocol and reconnection status without leaving the settings page.
- **Kiosk: scale dot visible on header** — Connected-state dot changed from green-on-green to white fill + green glow, clearly visible on any background.
- **Kiosk: reconfigure BLE scale** — New "Riconfigura bilancia BLE" button in Settings; shows amber notice with download link if the installed APK predates the `reconfigureScale()` bridge method.
- **Nutrition analysis dashboard** — Category distribution pie chart (3D conic-gradient), health/variety/freshness score bars, alternates with the anti-waste section hourly.
- **Screensaver nutrition panel** — Animated 3D pie + donut ring scores rotate with fact cards every 5 minutes in the screensaver overlay.
- **Automatic error reporting** — Unhandled JS errors, Android crashes and PHP exceptions are silently posted to `api/?action=report_error`; the server deduplicates by fingerprint and creates or comments on a GitHub Issue automatically. Crash details are persisted to `SharedPreferences` so even errors that prevent network I/O are sent on the next launch.
- **Demo mode (JS)** — Full frontend demo with mock pantry data, Gemini enabled, Bring! writes silently no-op'd; accessible via `?demo=1` or `.env` `DEMO_MODE=true`.
- **Graceful Bring! no-key state** — When Bring! credentials are not configured, the shopping tab shows a friendly message with a direct link to Settings instead of a raw error.
- **Use-quantity guard** — Consuming more than the stocked quantity at a given location is now blocked client-side with a shake animation on the quantity field.
- **Kiosk v1.6.0: BLE scale gateway integrated** — The standalone Scale Gateway app is no longer needed. BLE scanning, GATT connection and the WebSocket server (`:8765`) now run as a built-in `GatewayService` foreground service inside the kiosk app. Setup step 4 shows a live BLE device scan — users select their scale directly, no external APK install required. The external gateway app is deprecated.
- **Kiosk setup wizard overhaul** — Auto-discovery rewritten with `ExecutorCompletionService` + `NetworkInterface` (no deprecated `WifiManager`), 60 parallel TCP pre-checks, real-time UI feedback, ports 80/443/8080/8443, correct LAN subnet detection (VPN/cellular interfaces filtered, `wlan`/`eth` prioritised).
- **Kiosk permissions flow** — Grant button transforms into a green "✅ Permessi concessi — Continua →" button after permissions are granted instead of just showing a card.
- **3 new AI features (Gemini)** — Storage/shelf-life hint shown inline in the add form; AI-enriched shopping suggestions with a short practical tip per item; plain-language anomaly explanation via a "🤖 Spiega" button on anomaly banners.
- **Security hardening** — `get_settings` no longer exposes API keys in plain text (boolean flags only); `save_settings` protected by optional `SETTINGS_TOKEN` (validated with `hash_equals`); native `DEMO_MODE` in `.env` blocks all write operations at the PHP router level before any other guard.
- **Real-time webapp update detection** — An inline header pill appears when a newer release is on GitHub (checked on load + every 30 min); no intrusive full-page banners.
- **Gemini availability flag** — All AI entry points check `_geminiAvailable` before firing; the header button shows a visual no-AI state (greyed + amber dot) when no key is configured.
- **Dashboard skeleton loading** — Stat cards show an animated shimmer while data loads instead of a jarring `0` flash for 3–5 seconds.
- **APK self-update with conflict recovery** — Both Kiosk and Scale Gateway use the `PackageInstaller` session API for OTA installs; a signature conflict now shows a dialog to uninstall the old version instead of a cryptic failure.
- **Smarter low-quantity alerts** — The "suspiciously low quantity" banner is no longer raised for a partially-used entry when the same product has stock in another location.
- **Non-alarmist expired banner** — Adapts icon, colour, and title to the actual safety level: green ✅ for long-life products still safe, amber 👀 for items to check, red 🚫 only for genuinely dangerous items.

## ✨ Features

### 📦 Inventory Management
- **Barcode scanning** — Scan products with your phone camera using QuaggaJS
- **AI identification** — Take a photo and let Google Gemini identify the product, with suggestions from your existing inventory; gracefully shows a friendly message when AI quota is exhausted instead of a raw API error
- **Smart locations** — Track items across Pantry, Fridge, Freezer, and custom locations
- **Expiry tracking** — Automatic shelf-life estimation based on product type and storage
- **Opened product tracking** — Reduced shelf-life calculation when packages are opened; opened-product expiry is now also checked when building banner alerts (not just the dashboard section)
- **Vacuum-sealed support** — Extended expiry dates for vacuum-sealed items
- **Anomaly detection** — Banner alerts for suspicious quantities and consumption predictions with inline correction; dismiss button now shows the current inventory quantity so the action is unambiguous ("La quantità è giusta (2 pz)")

### 🤖 AI-Powered (Google Gemini)
- **Expiry date reading** — Photograph a label and extract the expiry date automatically
- **Product identification** — Point your camera at any product for instant recognition
- **Existing product matching** — AI scan shows matching products already in your pantry before suggesting new ones
- **Storage & shelf-life hint** — When adding a new product, Gemini suggests the optimal storage location and shelf-life in the background; shown as an inline AI badge next to the expiry estimate
- **Recipe generation** — Get personalized recipes based on what's in your pantry; streams live via Server-Sent Events so results appear as they are generated
- **Smart chat assistant** — Ask questions about your inventory, get cooking tips
- **Shopping suggestions with tips** — AI-powered purchase recommendations, each enriched with a short practical buying/storing tip
- **Anomaly explanation** — "🤖 Spiega" button on anomaly banners explains in plain language why a discrepancy likely occurred and what to do
- **Model fallback** — All AI endpoints try `gemini-2.5-flash` first and fall back to `gemini-2.0-flash` automatically
- **Graceful no-key state** — When no Gemini key is configured, AI entry points show a friendly message; the header button is visually greyed with an amber dot

### 🛒 Shopping List
- **Bring! integration** — Sync with the [Bring!](https://www.getbring.com/) shopping list app
- **Generic shopping names** — Products are grouped by type ("Latte", "Affettato", "Panna da cucina") rather than brand, keeping the Bring! list clean and consolidated
- **Smart predictions** — Know what you'll need before you run out
- **Auto-add on depletion** — When a product reaches zero the app adds it to Bring! automatically, no confirmation needed
- **Auto-remove on scan** — Products are removed from the shopping list when scanned in  - **Auto-migration** — Items already on the Bring! list are silently renamed to their generic name in the background (throttled, runs on list load)
  - **Catalog coverage** — All product types resolve to a German Bring! catalog key for icon and category display in the Bring! app

### 🍳 Cooking Mode
- **Step-by-step guidance** — Follow recipes with a hands-free cooking interface
- **Text-to-Speech** — Voice readout of recipe steps; supports browser Web Speech API, native Android TTS (kiosk), or a custom REST endpoint (Home Assistant, etc.); retries voice loading for up to 10 seconds with a fallback refresh button; TTS activates automatically without requiring the global TTS setting to be enabled
- **Auto-read on navigate** — Each step is read aloud automatically when you tap Next or Previous; the first step is read when entering cooking mode
- **Timer voice alerts** — 10-second countdown warning spoken aloud before each timer expires; expiry announced vocally when time is up
- **Recipe completion** — "Buon appetito!" spoken when the last step is confirmed
- **Built-in timer** — Automatic timer suggestions based on recipe instructions
- **Ingredient tracking** — Mark ingredients as used during cooking; leftover quantities prompt a "move to another location" flow

### 📊 Dashboard
- **Waste tracking** — Monitor consumed vs. wasted products over 30 days
- **Anti-waste report** — Personalised waste rate vs. national average with annual kg estimate; shown above the expiring-items list
- **Expiry alerts** — Visual warnings for expired and soon-to-expire items
- **Opened products panel** — Tracks partially-used items; expiry is recalculated from the opening date using AI (Gemini) + per-category rule fallback; whole sealed packages always keep their original manufacturer expiry; conf items with mixed whole + fractional units are shown as two separate entries
- **Freezer shelf-life** — Granular per-product estimates (USDA/EFSA): fish 120 d, poultry 270 d, whole red-meat cuts 365 d, mince 120 d, vegetables/fruit 270 d, generic 180 d; AI + cache still take priority over rules
- **Safety ratings** — Smart assessment of expired product safety (by category and location); expired unsafe items shown with a red danger banner and "L'ho buttato" as the primary action
- **Expired product banner** — Products that have passed their effective shelf-life (including opened-product reduced expiry) appear in the top notification banner; icon, colour and title adapt to the actual safety level (✅ green for safe, 👀 amber to check, 🚫 red for danger); high-risk items get a prominent discard action
- **Quick recipe bar** — One-tap recipe suggestion using expiring products
- **Anomaly banner** — Scrollable banner with suspicious quantities and consumption prediction mismatches, with one-tap correction or inline edit
- **Expired/expiring alerts** — Priority-sorted banner notifications for expired and soon-to-expire products with use, throw, edit, and dismiss actions
- **Swipe navigation** — Touch swipe or tap arrows/dots to browse banner notifications
- **Quick-access buttons** — Recently used and most popular products shown on the inventory page for fast access

### 📱 Progressive Web App
- **Mobile-first design** — Optimized for phones, works on tablets and desktop
- **Installable** — Add to home screen for a native app experience
- **Multi-device** — Settings and data sync across devices on the same server

### ⚖️ Smart Scale Integration (Add-on)
- **Bluetooth gateway** — Connects a BLE smart scale to EverShelf via local WebSocket
- **SSE relay** — Server-side relay avoids mixed-content (HTTPS→WS) issues
- **Auto-discovery** — Server scans LAN to find the gateway automatically
- **Auto weight reading** — When adding/using a product with unit g/ml, weight fills automatically
- **10g threshold** — Ignores readings that haven't changed enough between products  - **Duplicate-reading prevention** — Server-side 12-second dedup window rejects a second scale-triggered deduction of the same product, guarding against BLE multi-fire- **ml conversion hint** — Shows "weight in grams → will be converted to ml" when product unit is ml
- **Stability + auto-confirm** — 10s stable wait + 5s countdown before confirming
- **Real-time status** — Scale connection indicator always visible in the header
- **Multi-protocol** — Supports Bluetooth SIG Weight Scale, Body Composition, Xiaomi Mi Scale 2 and 100+ models
- **Built into kiosk (v1.6.0+)** — BLE gateway runs as an integrated foreground service inside the [EverShelf Kiosk](evershelf-kiosk/) app; no separate APK needed. The standalone gateway app in [`evershelf-scale-gateway/`](evershelf-scale-gateway/) is deprecated but kept for non-kiosk use cases.

### 📺 Android Kiosk Mode (Add-on)
- **Dedicated tablet app** — Full-screen WebView wrapper for wall-mounted kitchen tablets
- **True kiosk lock** — Screen pinning blocks home/recent buttons
- **Setup wizard** — 6-step guided configuration (language, welcome, permissions, server URL, BLE scale scan, screensaver, summary)
- **Smart auto-discovery** — Scans the LAN in parallel (60 threads, TCP pre-check, ports 80/443/8080/8443) with real-time UI feedback; correctly identifies the device's Wi-Fi/Ethernet subnet (VPN and cellular interfaces are filtered out)
- **Built-in BLE scale gateway** — `GatewayService` foreground service; BLE scanning + WebSocket server `:8765` run directly inside the kiosk app. Select your scale in step 5 of the wizard — no external app required
- **Scale auto-configuration** — After selecting the BLE device, the wizard writes `scale_enabled` and `scale_gateway_url=ws://127.0.0.1:8765` to the server automatically
- **Camera & mic permissions** — Full hardware access for barcode scanning and voice; grant button transforms to a green confirmation after granting
- **Native TTS bridge** — Cooking mode voice readout uses the Android TextToSpeech engine directly, bypassing Web Speech API voice limitations; no offline voice packs required
- **Hard refresh** — ↻ button clears WebView cache to pick up web app updates
- **Update notifications** — Checks GitHub releases every 6h, shows banner when updates available
- **SSL support** — Accepts self-signed certificates
- **Android kiosk app** — [`evershelf-kiosk/`](evershelf-kiosk/) — downloadable APK

SETTINGS_TOKEN=

# Optional: Demo mode — block all write operations at the router level
DEMO_MODE=false
```

### Web Server Configuration

<details>
<summary><strong>Apache (.htaccess)</strong></summary>

The app works out of the box with Apache if placed in the web root or a subdirectory. Make sure `mod_rewrite` is enabled and `AllowOverride All` is set.

```apache
<Directory /var/www/html/evershelf>
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Nginx</strong></summary>

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-server.local;
    root /var/www/html/evershelf;
    index index.html;

    location /api/ {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            include fastcgi_params;
        }
    }

    # Deny access to sensitive files
    location ~ /\.env { deny all; }
    location ~ /data/ { deny all; }
    location ~ /backup\.sh { deny all; }
}
```

</details>

### HTTPS Setup (Recommended)

Camera access requires HTTPS on most mobile browsers. Options:
- **Let's Encrypt** with Certbot (for public-facing servers)
- **Self-signed certificate** (for local network only)
- **Reverse proxy** (e.g., Caddy, Traefik) with automatic TLS

### Cron Job (Optional)

Set up a cron job for smart shopping predictions:

```bash
# Run every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * php /path/to/evershelf/api/cron_smart_shopping.php >> /path/to/evershelf/data/cron.log 2>&1
```

### Backup (Optional)

The included `backup.sh` creates local daily backups of your database:

```bash
# Run daily at 3 AM
0 3 * * * /path/to/evershelf/backup.sh
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Credentials** are stored in `.env` (server-side, never committed to Git)
- **Database** stays local — never pushed to remote repositories
- **API keys are never exposed to the browser** — `get_settings` returns only boolean flags (`gemini_key_set`, `settings_token_set`), never raw key values
- **Settings write protection** — set `SETTINGS_TOKEN` in `.env` to require a secret token (`X-Settings-Token` header) for all `save_settings` calls; validated with `hash_equals` to prevent timing attacks
- **Demo / public mode** — set `DEMO_MODE=true` to block all write operations at the PHP router level before any business logic runs
- The API uses **parameterized SQL queries** (PDO prepared statements) against injection
- **Input validation** on all inventory operations (quantity bounds, location whitelist)
- Consider adding **reverse-proxy authentication** (e.g. Authelia, Nginx `auth_basic`) if the server is accessible from the internet

---

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Run PHP's built-in server for local development
php -S localhost:8080 -t /path/to/evershelf

# Check PHP syntax
php -l api/index.php
php -l api/database.php
```

The application uses no build tools — edit files directly and refresh.
