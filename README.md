## ✨ Features

### 🏠 NEW — Home Assistant Integration

EverShelf has a **native Home Assistant integration** available on HACS.  
Connect your pantry to your smart home in minutes — no YAML, no manual sensor setup.

[![Install via HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=dadaloop82&repository=ha-evershelf&category=integration)
&nbsp;
[![Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=evershelf)

**What you get:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **16 sensors** | Expiry counts, stock levels by location (pantry / fridge / freezer), shopping list total, AI API usage, last backup timestamp, days to next expiry |
| **6 binary sensors** | Expired items, expiring items, expiring today, shopping list active, backup overdue, Bring! connected |
| **5 action buttons** | Refresh data, Refresh prices, **Suggest Recipe** (AI — result as HA notification), Sync smart shopping, Clear expired rows |
| **Shopping list todo** | Bidirectional sync — add, remove, check off items directly from HA |
| **Expiry calendar** | Every product's expiry date as a native HA calendar event — works with the calendar card and any calendar automation |
| **Quick-add text entity** | Type a product name in HA to instantly add it to the shopping list (great for voice assistants / Assist) |
| **6 services** | `add_to_shopping`, `mark_used`, `refresh`, `suggest_recipe`, `refresh_prices`, `clear_expired` |
| **Auto-discovery** | Detected automatically via Zeroconf/mDNS when `avahi-daemon` runs on the EverShelf host |
| **5 languages** | English, Italian, German, French, Spanish |

> **Requires a self-hosted EverShelf instance.** The integration talks directly to your server — no cloud involved.

### 📦 Inventory Management
- **Export inventory** — Download the full inventory as a UTF-8 CSV (Excel-compatible) or open a print-ready page to save as PDF; export button always visible in the inventory page header
- **Barcode scanning** — Scan products with your phone camera using QuaggaJS; last 20 scanned products saved as tappable chips so you can re-select them without rescanning
- **AI identification** — Take a photo and let Google Gemini identify the product, with suggestions from your existing inventory; gracefully shows a friendly message when AI quota is exhausted instead of a raw API error
- **Smart locations** — Track items across Pantry, Fridge, Freezer, and custom locations
- **Expiry tracking** — Automatic shelf-life estimation based on product type and storage
- **Opened product tracking** — Reduced shelf-life calculation when packages are opened; opened-product expiry is now also checked when building banner alerts (not just the dashboard section)
- **Vacuum-sealed support** — Extended expiry dates for vacuum-sealed items; products sealed under vacuum are only flagged as expired after a configurable grace period past the printed date (`VACUUM_EXPIRY_EXTENSION_DAYS`, default 30 days, configurable in `.env`)
- **Anomaly detection** — Banner alerts for suspicious quantities and consumption predictions with inline correction; dismiss button now shows the current inventory quantity so the action is unambiguous ("Quantity is correct (2 pcs)")

### 🤖 AI-Powered (Google Gemini)
- **Expiry date reading** — Photograph a label and extract the expiry date automatically
- **Product identification** — Point your camera at any product for instant recognition
- **Existing product matching** — AI scan shows matching products already in your pantry before suggesting new ones
- **Storage & shelf-life hint** — When adding a new product, Gemini suggests the optimal storage location and shelf-life in the background; shown as an inline AI badge next to the expiry estimate
- **Recipe generation** — Get personalized recipes based on what's in your pantry; streams live via Server-Sent Events so results appear as they are generated
- **Smart chat assistant** — Ask questions about your inventory, get cooking tips
- **Shopping suggestions with tips** — AI-powered purchase recommendations, each enriched with a short practical buying/storing tip
- **Anomaly explanation** — "Explain" button on anomaly banners explains in plain language why a discrepancy likely occurred and what to do
- **Model fallback** — All AI endpoints try `gemini-2.5-flash` first and fall back to `gemini-2.0-flash` automatically
- **Graceful no-key state** — When no Gemini key is configured, AI entry points show a friendly message; the header button is visually greyed with an amber dot

### 🛒 Shopping List
- **Bring! integration** — Sync with the [Bring!](https://www.getbring.com/) shopping list app
- **Generic shopping names** — Products are grouped by type (e.g. "Milk", "Cold cuts", "Cooking cream") rather than brand, keeping the Bring! list clean and consolidated
- **Smart predictions** — Know what you'll need before you run out
- **Auto-add on depletion** — When a product reaches zero the app adds it to Bring! automatically, no confirmation needed
- **Auto-remove on scan** — Products are removed from the shopping list when scanned in  - **Auto-migration** — Items already on the Bring! list are silently renamed to their generic name in the background (throttled, runs on list load)
  - **Catalog coverage** — All product types resolve to a German Bring! catalog key for icon and category display in the Bring! app

### 🍳 Cooking Mode
- **♻️ Zero-waste tips** — For each cooking step that generates reusable scraps (peels, cooking water, egg whites, cheese rinds, bread crusts, vegetable tops, etc.), a dismissible ♻️ tip card appears with a practical reuse idea; tips are generated by Gemini as part of the recipe at no extra API cost; opt-in toggle in Settings (default OFF)
- **Step-by-step guidance** — Follow recipes with a hands-free cooking interface
- **Text-to-Speech** — Voice readout of recipe steps; supports browser Web Speech API, native Android TTS (kiosk), or a custom REST endpoint (Home Assistant, etc.); retries voice loading for up to 10 seconds with a fallback refresh button; TTS activates automatically without requiring the global TTS setting to be enabled
- **Auto-read on navigate** — Each step is read aloud automatically when you tap Next or Previous; the first step is read when entering cooking mode
- **Timer voice alerts** — 10-second countdown warning spoken aloud before each timer expires; expiry announced vocally when time is up
- **Recipe completion** — "Bon appétit!" announced via TTS when the last step is confirmed
- **Built-in timer** — Automatic timer suggestions based on recipe instructions
- **Ingredient tracking** — Mark ingredients as used during cooking; leftover quantities prompt a "move to another location" flow

### 📊 Dashboard
- **Waste tracking** — Monitor consumed vs. wasted products over 30 days
- **Anti-waste report** — Personalised waste rate vs. national average with annual kg estimate; shown above the expiring-items list
- **Expiry alerts** — Visual warnings for expired and soon-to-expire items
- **Opened products panel** — Tracks partially-used items; expiry is recalculated from the opening date using AI (Gemini) + per-category rule fallback; whole sealed packages always keep their original manufacturer expiry; conf items with mixed whole + fractional units are shown as two separate entries
- **Freezer shelf-life** — Granular per-product estimates (USDA/EFSA): fish 120 d, poultry 270 d, whole red-meat cuts 365 d, mince 120 d, vegetables/fruit 270 d, generic 180 d; AI + cache still take priority over rules
- **Safety ratings** — Smart assessment of expired product safety (by category and location); expired unsafe items shown with a red danger banner and a discard action as the primary action
- **Expired product banner** — Products that have passed their effective shelf-life (including opened-product reduced expiry) appear in the top notification banner; icon, colour and title adapt to the actual safety level (✅ green for safe, 👀 amber to check, 🚫 red for danger); high-risk items get a prominent discard action
- **Quick recipe bar** — One-tap recipe suggestion using expiring products
- **Anomaly banner** — Scrollable banner with suspicious quantities and consumption prediction mismatches, with one-tap correction or inline edit
- **Expired/expiring alerts** — Priority-sorted banner notifications for expired and soon-to-expire products with use, throw, edit, and dismiss actions
- **Swipe navigation** — Touch swipe or tap arrows/dots to browse banner notifications
- **Quick-access buttons** — Recently used and most popular products shown on the inventory page for fast access

### 🌙 Appearance
- **Dark mode** — Three modes: Light, Dark, and Auto (time-based: dark from 20:00 to 07:00, light otherwise); applies immediately without page reload; auto mode re-evaluates every 5 minutes, so night/day transitions happen automatically even on always-on kiosk displays; theme is applied before the first render to prevent a white flash
- **Global settings tab** — A dedicated **⚙️ General** tab groups all system-wide settings (language, currency, theme, screensaver, zero-waste tips, export) at the top of the Settings panel

### �️ Database Maintenance
- **Automatic cleanup** — Recipes older than `RECIPE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 7) and transactions older than `TRANSACTION_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 7) are deleted automatically on every cron cycle; SQLite `VACUUM` runs after each cleanup to keep the file compact
- **Manual cleanup** — Trigger immediately via `GET /api/?action=db_cleanup`
- **Compact by default** — Fresh installs stay small; large accumulated databases shrink back to a few hundred KB within one cron cycle

### �📱 Progressive Web App
- **Mobile-first design** — Optimized for phones, works on tablets and desktop
- **Installable** — Add to home screen for a native app experience
- **Multi-device** — All user data (shopping tags, pinned items, location preferences, scan history) is stored server-side in SQLite and shared across every device on the same instance; no data is siloed in a single browser's localStorage
### 📶 Offline Mode
- **Automatic detection** — Full-screen overlay appears immediately on network loss; shows a "Continue offline" button after 3 s, and auto-enters offline mode after 8 s
- **Local inventory cache** — Inventory is synced to `localStorage` at every startup and on each successful API call; the offline view always reflects the last known state
- **Write queue** — Add, use, update and delete operations performed while offline are queued locally and synced to the server automatically on reconnect (including after a page refresh)
- **Optimistic UI** — Queued writes are applied immediately to the local cache so the interface stays responsive
- **Offline-computed stats** — Expiring and expired items are derived client-side from the cache; dashboard stat cards show real counts instead of zeros
- **AI/network sections hidden** — Anti-waste chart, nutrition analysis, recipe generator, price fetching, and Gemini chat are hidden in offline mode; the inventory, history, and manually-managed shopping list remain fully functional
- **Broken image fallback** — External product images (Open Food Facts, etc.) that fail to load are replaced with a neutral grey placeholder, keeping the layout intact
- **Startup recovery** — If the page is refreshed while operations are queued, they are detected and synced automatically on the next successful startup
- **Buffered error reporting** — `remoteLog` and `reportError` calls made while offline are stored locally and flushed to the server (and to GitHub issues) when the connection is restored
### ⚖️ Smart Scale Integration (Add-on)
- **Bluetooth gateway** — Connects a BLE smart scale to EverShelf via local WebSocket
- **SSE relay** — Server-side relay avoids mixed-content (HTTPS→WS) issues
- **Auto-discovery** — Server scans LAN to find the gateway automatically
- **Auto weight reading** — When adding/using a product with unit g/ml, weight fills automatically
- **10g threshold** — Ignores readings that haven't changed enough between products  - **Duplicate-reading prevention** — Server-side 12-second dedup window rejects a second scale-triggered deduction of the same product, guarding against BLE multi-fire- **ml conversion hint** — Shows "weight in grams → will be converted to ml" when product unit is ml
- **Stability + auto-confirm** — 10s stable wait + 5s countdown before confirming
- **Real-time status** — Scale connection indicator always visible in the header
- **Multi-protocol** — Supports Bluetooth SIG Weight Scale, Body Composition, Xiaomi Mi Scale 2 and 100+ models
- **Built into kiosk (v1.6.0+)** — BLE gateway runs as an integrated foreground service inside the [EverShelf Kiosk](evershelf-kiosk/) app; no separate APK needed.

### 📺 Android Kiosk Mode (Add-on)
- **Dedicated tablet app** — Full-screen WebView wrapper for wall-mounted kitchen tablets
- **True kiosk lock** — Screen pinning blocks home/recent buttons
- **Setup wizard** — 6-step guided configuration (language, welcome, permissions, server URL, BLE scale scan, screensaver, summary)
- **Smart auto-discovery** — Scans the LAN in parallel (60 threads, TCP pre-check, ports 80/443/8080/8443) with real-time UI feedback; correctly identifies the device's Wi-Fi/Ethernet subnet (VPN and cellular interfaces are filtered out)
- **Built-in BLE scale gateway** — `GatewayService` foreground service; BLE scanning + WebSocket server `:8765` run directly inside the kiosk app. Select your scale in step 5 of the wizard — no external app required
- **Scale auto-configuration** — After selecting the BLE device, the wizard writes `scale_enabled` and `scale_gateway_url=ws://127.0.0.1:8765` to the server automatically
- **Camera & mic permissions** — Full hardware access for barcode scanning and voice; grant button transforms to a green confirmation after granting
- **Native TTS bridge** — Cooking mode voice readout uses the Android TextToSpeech engine directly, bypassing Web Speech API voice limitations; no offline voice packs required
- **Hard refresh** — ↻ button clears WebView cache to pick up web app updates
- **Update notifications** — Checks GitHub releases every 6h, shows banner when updates available
- **SSL support** — Accepts self-signed certificates
- **Android kiosk app** — [`evershelf-kiosk/`](evershelf-kiosk/) — downloadable APK

### Web Server Configuration

<details>
<summary><strong>Apache (.htaccess)</strong></summary>

The app works out of the box with Apache if placed in the web root or a subdirectory. Make sure `mod_rewrite` is enabled and `AllowOverride All` is set.

```apache
<Directory /var/www/html/evershelf>
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Nginx</strong></summary>

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-server.local;
    root /var/www/html/evershelf;
    index index.html;

    location /api/ {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            include fastcgi_params;
        }
    }

    # Deny access to sensitive files
    location ~ /\.env { deny all; }
    location ~ /data/ { deny all; }
    location ~ /backup\.sh { deny all; }
}
```

</details>

### HTTPS Setup (Recommended)

Camera access requires HTTPS on most mobile browsers. Options:
- **Let's Encrypt** with Certbot (for public-facing servers)
- **Self-signed certificate** (for local network only)
- **Reverse proxy** (e.g., Caddy, Traefik) with automatic TLS

### Cron Job (Optional)

Set up a cron job for smart shopping predictions:

```bash
# Run every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * php /path/to/evershelf/api/cron_smart_shopping.php >> /path/to/evershelf/data/cron.log 2>&1
```

### Backup (Optional)

The included `backup.sh` creates local daily backups of your database:

```bash
# Run daily at 3 AM
0 3 * * * /path/to/evershelf/backup.sh
```

### Google Drive Backup (Optional)

EverShelf supports automatic daily backups to Google Drive via OAuth 2.0. This works on any server, including private IP / local network setups (no public domain required).

**Setup:**

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and select or create a project.
2. Enable the **Google Drive API** (`APIs & Services → Enable APIs → Google Drive API`).
3. Go to `APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth client ID`.
4. Application type: **Web application**.
5. Add **`http://localhost`** as an Authorized Redirect URI (this is the key — it works even without a real domain).
6. Copy **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into EverShelf Settings → Backup.
7. Enter your **Google Drive Folder ID** (the last part of the folder URL).
8. Click **Authorize with Google** and sign in.
9. The browser will redirect to `http://localhost` and may show a connection error — **this is expected**. Copy the full URL from the address bar (e.g. `http://localhost/?code=4%2F0A...`) and paste it into the field that appears in EverShelf, then click **Submit**.

> **Note:** While the OAuth app is in *Testing* status in Google Cloud Console, you must add your Google account as a test user under `APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen → Test users`.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Credentials** are stored in `.env` (server-side, never committed to Git)
- **Database** stays local — never pushed to remote repositories
- **Apache/Nginx hardening** — `.env`, `data/`, and `logs/` are blocked from direct HTTP access
- **API token** — set `API_TOKEN` in `.env` to require `X-API-Token` on all API calls (Home Assistant: `?api_token=`)
- **API keys are never exposed to the browser** — `get_settings` returns only boolean flags (`gemini_key_set`, `ha_token_set`, …)
- **GitHub Issues token** — stored encrypted as `GH_ISSUE_TOKEN_ENC` + `GH_ISSUE_TOKEN_KEY` (see `scripts/encrypt-gh-token.php`)
- **Settings write protection** — `save_settings` requires the same API token when configured; validated with `hash_equals`
- **Demo / public mode** — set `DEMO_MODE=true` to block all write operations at the PHP router level before any business logic runs
- The API uses **parameterized SQL queries** (PDO prepared statements) against injection
- **Input validation** on all inventory operations (quantity bounds, location whitelist)
- Consider adding **reverse-proxy authentication** (e.g. Authelia, Nginx `auth_basic`) if the server is accessible from the internet

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Run PHP's built-in server for local development
php -S localhost:8080 -t /path/to/evershelf

# Check PHP syntax
php -l api/index.php
php -l api/database.php
```

The application uses no build tools — edit files directly and refresh.
