# Changelog

All notable changes to EverShelf will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] — Ideas & Roadmap

> Ideas collected during development. No priority or date implied.

- **Recipe scraps tips** — During cooking steps, detect "waste" generated (peels, cores, bones, eggshells, coffee grounds, citrus zest, etc.) and surface AI-powered tips on how to reuse them (compost, natural cleaner, broth, candied peel, etc.). Could be shown as an optional collapsible hint card below the step that generates the scrap.

## [1.7.39] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **`resolve_barcode` API** — Single round-trip: local catalog lookup plus **parallel** external search (Open Food Facts IT/world, UPC Item DB, Open Products Facts, Open Beauty Facts via `curl_multi`). Results are stored in SQLite `barcode_cache` for instant repeat scans.
- **Spesa barcode fast path** — In shopping mode, a successful scan opens the **add form directly** (skips the intermediate action page).
- **Session barcode cache** — In-memory cache avoids duplicate API calls when scanning many items in one trip.
- **Manual expiry flag (`expiry_user_set`)** — User-entered expiry dates are kept when changing location, vacuum seal, or moving stock; only auto-estimated dates are recalculated.
- **Family sibling 24h dedup** — After confirming “Sì, tutto ok” on a similar in-stock product, the check prompt is suppressed for the same `shopping_name` family for 24 hours (synced via `family_sibling_confirmed` in app settings).
- **Family sibling stock line** — Spesa prompt shows readable stock (e.g. `4 conf (da 20g)`); new `family_sibling_check` / `family_sibling_stock` strings in IT/EN/DE/FR/ES.
- **Quick-edit product notes** — Notes field in the inline name/brand editor on the product action page.

### Fixed
- **Kiosk / WebView stability** — Guard `$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']` when null; fix JS temporal-dead-zone crashes (`setProgress`, `enriched` → `enrichedRaw`, `duplicateNames`); lazy-load ZBar WASM so kiosk startup no longer OOM-crashes.
- **Empty barcode SQL error** — Multiple products with `barcode = ''` violated SQLite UNIQUE; empty strings are normalized to `NULL` (migration included).
- **Spesa ghost products** — Finished/catalog AI candidates and scan recents no longer show zero-stock items in shopping mode; `family_sibling_suggest` requires live inventory quantity.
- **Insalata di riso misclassification** — Prepared rice salads (e.g. Ponti) map to `pasta` instead of fresh `verdura`; server and client rules aligned.
- **Family sibling prompt readability** — Quantity and question text use high-contrast colours on the dark overlay.
- **Move after use / recipe move** — Respects manually set expiry (`expiry_user_set`); purchased items marked on blocklist after spesa add.

### Changed
- **Barcode lookup** — Replaced sequential API waterfall (up to ~15s) with parallel fetch (~1–2s first hit); 30-minute negative cache for unknown codes.
- **Local barcode search** — Automatically tries EAN-13 / UPC-A variant barcodes.

## [1.7.38] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **Finished products on shopping list** — Depleted items are now added to Bring! under their generic `shopping_name` (e.g. “Affettato”). If the generic is already on the list, the specific variant is appended to the specification instead of being skipped. Confirming a ghost/finished product from the dashboard banner also triggers this flow.
- **Unstable shopping total** — Dashboard, Spesa tab, Home Assistant and screensaver now share one **weekly canonical total** (`PRICE_UPDATE_WEEKS=1`). Totals use **1 package per list item** (no more day-to-day swings from smart-shopping suggested quantities). AI prices are fetched only for items missing from cache; manual 🔄 refresh forces an update.
- **Screensaver price mismatch** — Screensaver waits for the canonical total sync before displaying the amount, matching the other surfaces.

### Changed
- **Shopping list UI** — Generic list entries show the group name with specific finished variants underneath (same pattern as smart shopping suggestions).

## [1.7.37] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **Recipe pantry false positives** — Generated recipes no longer mark ingredients as ✅ in pantry when the product is not in stock or the name does not strictly match an inventory item (score ≥ 80, no generic alias expansion like *formaggio* → any cheese). AI prompt now receives the full in-stock list and explicit rules forbidding invented ingredient names.
- **`renderRecipe` crash** — Restored missing `qtyNum` variable when reopening archived recipes with pantry ingredients (ReferenceError on the "Use ingredient" button).

### Changed
- **`re-enrich-recipe.php`** — Re-applies strict pantry matching before stock hints when fixing archived recipes.

## [1.7.36] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Recipe ingredient stock hints** — Pantry ingredients in generated and archived recipes now show a small line under each item: how much you have in stock and how much would remain after use. Quantities are summed across all storage locations.
- **Zero-waste use-all rule** — When the leftover would be less than **5% of the full sealed package** (or **10%** when less than one full unit is left on an opened pack), the recipe quantity is automatically bumped to use everything on hand (♻️ badge + note in all 5 languages).
- **Ghost product detection** — Dashboard anomaly banner now surfaces products that vanished from inventory (ledger says stock should exist but no rows remain), with a restore prompt and quantity input.
- **`inventory_restore_ghost` API** — Restores a vanished product row from the banner without losing transaction history.
- **`product_merge` API** — Merges duplicate product records (inventory, transactions, aliases) into a single canonical product.
- **Maintenance scripts** — `scripts/sync-i18n.py` (5-language key sync), `scripts/re-enrich-recipe.php` (re-apply stock hints to archived recipes), `scripts/merge-duplicate-products.php` (batch duplicate merge).

### Fixed
- **Unified shopping total** — Dashboard, Spesa page and screensaver now share one canonical server-side total (`shopping_total_cache`); background refresh runs during screensaver too.
- **Recipe stream auth** — `generate_recipe_stream` and other direct `fetch()` calls now send the API token consistently, fixing 401 errors during recipe generation.
- **Home Assistant auth compatibility** — HA integration endpoints accept the configured API token without breaking legacy setups.
- **Security hardening** — API bootstrap modularised; scale SSE relay and sensitive routes require auth; env migration script for legacy installs.
- **Dashboard banner i18n** — Fixed raw translation keys (`dashboard.banner_*`) showing in the UI; full sync across IT/EN/DE/FR/ES with cache bust.
- **Ghost banner permanently hidden** — Removed incorrect `fin_*` hide logic that suppressed vanished-product alerts after a false "finished" confirmation.
- **`deleteInventory` / `use_all` dedup** — Inventory deletions now log transactions; duplicate `use_all` within 60 s is deduplicated; `confirmFinished` reconciles ledger mismatches.
- **Duplicate product prevention** — `saveProduct` blocks creating a second product with the same normalised name.
- **Recipe qty normalization** — conf+weight ingredients (e.g. ceci, basilico) now keep recipe amounts in grams/ml instead of copying the inventory conf count; use-all percentage is calculated on the sealed package size, not current stock.

## [1.7.35] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Barcode scanner accepts invalid codes** — Manual barcode input with an incorrect EAN checksum now blocks the lookup and shows an error (previously showed a warning but proceeded anyway). The native `BarcodeDetector` path now also validates EAN-8/EAN-13/UPC checksum before confirming a scan, consistent with the Quagga fallback which already did this check.
- **Recipe persons +/− buttons stopped working in the generation dialog** — A duplicate `adjustRecipePersons` function added for the post-generation rescaler was overriding the one that updated the persons input in the recipe setup dialog. The rescaler is now named `scaleRecipePersons` to avoid the conflict.

## [1.7.34] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- **AI visual barcode fallback** — When the barcode scanner fails to read a barcode within 5 seconds, EverShelf can now automatically capture a camera frame and send it to Gemini Vision to visually identify the product (name, brand, category). On success the product is saved and the inventory form opens just as if a barcode had been scanned. A new toggle in **Settings → Camera** (`AI visual identification (5s fallback)`) lets users enable or disable this feature at any time. Requires Gemini API key configured. Disabled by default.

## [1.7.33] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **HA sensor `shopping_total` always null** — `haInventorySensor` was reading `shopping_total_cache.json` with a 1-hour TTL (cache populated only by the JS frontend, so it was often empty). Extended TTL to 24 hours and added an inline fallback: when the cache is absent or stale, the sensor now computes the total directly from `shopping_price_cache.json` without any AI calls. Queries `shopping_list` joined to `products` for the canonical `shopping_name`, then looks up both v3 and legacy v0 cache key formats to maximise hit rate. Works in both internal and Bring shopping modes.
- **HA `ha_refresh_prices` using non-existent columns** — `haInventorySensor` and `haRefreshPrices` were querying `quantity`, `unit`, `checked` from `shopping_list` — columns that do not exist in that table (schema: `id, name, raw_name, specification, added_at, sort_order`). Changed to `SELECT name` with `shopping_name` join and default `qty=1 / unit=pz`.


## [1.7.32] - 2026-05-29

### Changed
- **Smarter expiry u2192 shopping list logic** — The "expiring soon" threshold is now 7 days (was 3), giving enough time to plan the next shopping trip. Items expiring soon are only flagged for restocking when the user is a **regular buyer** (`isRegular`) and either stock is low (<50%) or the consumption rate predicts the item will expire before being used. Non-regular products keep the old 3-day safety-net. Expired items are now only added to the shopping list when `isRegular || buyCount >= 2` — products that expired unused without ever being a staple no longer pollute the list; the expiry banner handles them.


## [1.7.31] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **New pack merges into opened pack on add** — `addToInventory` was looking for ANY existing row for the same product+location and adding the new quantity to it. This caused a newly purchased sealed pack to be silently merged with an already-opened pack, collapsing two physically distinct containers into one row and corrupting the `opened_at` timestamp. The fix now searches only for a **sealed** (unopened) row (`opened_at IS NULL`) to merge into. If only opened rows exist, a new sealed row is created instead — keeping the two packs separate and allowing the anomaly model and shelf-life tracker to work correctly.


## [1.7.30] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **False consumption anomaly with multi-row stock** — The anomaly detection banner was evaluating each inventory row in isolation. Products split across multiple rows (e.g. one opened pack with 1 pz + one sealed pack with 6 pz) incorrectly triggered a "consumed faster than expected" warning because only the opened row (1 pz) was compared against the model. The check now aggregates the total quantity across all rows for the same product before deciding to flag an anomaly. If the combined total ≥ expected remaining, the anomaly is suppressed.


## [1.7.29] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Buy-cycle consumption prediction** — Products that are never tracked per-use (salt, spices, cleaning supplies, etc.) now use the average time between restocks as a proxy for consumption rate. When a product has ≥ 3 purchase events and no individual `out` events, EverShelf calculates the average buy cycle (`(lastBuy - firstBuy) / (buyCount - 1)`) and estimates how many days of stock remain in the current cycle. The product appears in the smart shopping list with a reason like "Finisce tra ~12gg (ciclo medio 75gg)" before it runs out, rather than only after. These products are now also treated as `isRegular` so all stock-level urgency checks apply correctly.


## [1.7.28] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- **Duplicate auto-reported issues** — The GitHub issue reporter was relying solely on the GitHub Search API for deduplication. Because search indexing has a several-minutes lag, rapid error recurrences each created a new issue before the previous one was indexed, producing ~50 duplicate issues. The reporter now uses a local file cache (`data/reported_issue_fps.json`, with `/tmp/` fallback when `data/` is not writable) as the primary deduplication store. A 30-minute per-fingerprint comment throttle is also applied to prevent flooding an existing issue. GitHub Search is used only on first run or after a cache miss. Closes [#134](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/134) (and all duplicates #135–#183).

## [1.7.27] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **HA sensor enrichment** — All HA sensor attributes that list products now include full product details: `location`, `brand`, `category`, `days_remaining`, `opened_at`, `vacuum_sealed`, `default_quantity`, `package_unit`, `product_id`, `inventory_id`. Applies to `expiring_list`, the new `expired_list`, and the new `low_stock_list`.
- **HA `expired_list` attribute** — `sensor.evershelf_overview` now exposes `expired_list` (full details for all expired items, not just a count).
- **HA `low_stock_list` attribute** — New attribute listing all items with quantity ≤ 1 with full product info.
- **HA `sensor=product` endpoint** — New `GET /api/?action=ha_sensor&sensor=product` returns the full inventory with all product details. Optional filters: `&id=N`, `&name=...`, `&location=...`.
- **Inventory edit safety guard** — Confirm dialog when saving a quantity that is unusually large for its unit (e.g. 183 conf), preventing accidental data loss from unit-confusion typos.
- **Bread shelf-life in fridge** — Opened shelf-life rules added for piadina/crescia (2 days), packaged sliced bread/bauletto (4 days), and generic bread (3 days).

### Fixed
- **Recipe AI ingredient substitution** — Added explicit rule to both recipe prompts preventing Gemini from substituting ingredient forms (e.g. fresh tomatoes ↔ passata, fresh milk ↔ UHT ↔ cream, flour 00 ↔ wholemeal).
- **HA cron webhook payload** — Expiry alert webhook items now include full product details (brand, category, location, days_remaining, opened_at, vacuum_sealed) instead of only name/qty/unit/expiry_date.

### Docs
- `docs/wiki/Home-Assistant.md` — Documented new `sensor=product` endpoint, full product schema table, enriched webhook payload example, and Lovelace/automation template examples using `location` and `days_remaining`.

## [1.7.26] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **Monthly stats panel** — Third rotating card in the insight banner (anti-waste → nutrition → monthly stats, 1 minute each). Shows products consumed this month with a trend vs. the previous calendar month (↑/↓/→ with % delta), animated horizontal category bars, and badges for items added, wasted, and top-used product. Falls back gracefully when the current month has no transactions. Closes [#100](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/100).
- **Extended smart-shopping horizon for staples** — Items consumed ≥ 4 times/month now get a 28-day look-ahead window; ≥ 2 times/month get 21 days. Frequently used staples no longer disappear from the smart list between restocks. Closes [#98](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/98).

### Fixed
- **TTS test interactive confirmation** — Test timeout raised from 4 s to 10 s; instead of an error, the UI shows a YES/NO prompt ("Did you hear it?") so users can confirm or report failure explicitly.
- **`end()` PHP 8 reference error** — `_offFetchProduct()` passed the result of `??` directly to `end()`, which requires a variable. Fixed with a temporary variable.
- **Database migration crash on fresh installs** — `migrateDB()` tried to rename the `transactions` table before it existed. A `sqlite_master` guard now calls `initializeDB()` and returns early when the schema is absent. Closes [#131](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/131), [#133](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/133).
- **Health-check crash on empty database** — `db_row_count` query was executed even when the `inventory` table was missing, causing a fatal PDO error. The query is now skipped until the schema is fully initialised. Closes [#132](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/132).
- **Insight banner stuck on one panel** — Rotation interval was 1 hour (effectively invisible); now 60 seconds. `_applyInsightPhase` also now skips empty panels instead of always falling back to the anti-waste card, so the rotation works correctly even when a panel has no data.
- **Untranslated OpenFoodFacts category labels** — Categories stored as OFF slugs (`en:plant-based-foods-and-beverages`, `en:dairies`, …) were shown raw. A new `_normalizeCat()` PHP function maps ~60 OFF slugs to Italian app categories; counts are re-aggregated after normalisation so `en:dairies` + `en:milk` both contribute to `latticini`.

## [1.7.25] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Home Assistant integration** — Full bidirectional HA support: inventory sensor (`sensor.evershelf_*`) exposes item counts, expiring items, shopping total, opened items and next-expiry info. Webhooks fire on inventory changes (add/use/shopping). Daily cron alert notifies via HA for items expiring within the configured threshold. TTS announces cooking steps through HA Media Player. New Settings tab 🏠 with connection test, TTS preset (Piper, Google, Nabu Casa), webhook config, and YAML snippet for `configuration.yaml`. Resolves [#111](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/111).
- **Offline mode** — Full offline-first support. Full-screen overlay on network loss; "Continue offline" button after 3 s, auto-enter after 8 s. Inventory and settings are synced to `localStorage` at startup and cached on every successful API call. Writes (add/use/update/delete) are queued and synced on reconnect with optimistic UI updates. Pending operations survive page refresh and are re-synced automatically at next startup. AI/network-dependent sections (anti-waste chart, nutrition analysis, recipe generator, price fetching, Gemini chat) are hidden in offline mode. `remoteLog` and `reportError` are buffered offline and flushed on restore. Broken external images replaced with a grey placeholder.
- **Offline-computed dashboard** — While offline, `inventory_summary` and `stats` (expiring/expired/opened) are derived client-side from the local cache so all dashboard stat cards and expiry alerts show accurate data.

### Fixed
- **Offline banner flood** — Opened items in the offline `stats` response lacked `is_edible`; `!undefined` evaluated to `true`, causing every opened item to be shown as "not edible" in the dashboard banner. Field is now set to `true` (client-side shelf-life check already handles genuinely expired items).
- **Version update badge showing older versions** — `_checkWebappUpdate` used `latestTag !== _loadedVersion` (inequality only), so running a newer dev build triggered an "update available" badge for an older GitHub release. Now uses `_semverGt(latest, current)` so only genuinely newer releases trigger the badge.
- **Bring! items re-appearing after manual purchase removal** — `removeBringItem` and `confirmShoppingItemFound` now call `_markBringPurchased` immediately, and `autoAddCriticalItems` respects the blocklist for depleted items.
- **Barcode lookup false "not found"** — New `_offFetchProduct()` tries three barcode candidates (given, UPC-A↔EAN-13 conversion) across two Open Food Facts locales with auto-retry.
- **Partial throw from expired-items banner** — "Butta" now opens the throw modal (qty + location) instead of silently deleting the entire inventory row.
- **Related stock display when scanning branded products** — When scanning a product, the action page now shows a green card listing any inventory items from the same generic family already at home.

## [1.7.24] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **Dark mode resets to Auto on every reload** — `dark_mode` was never saved to `.env` (missing from `saveSettings` and `getServerSettings`). It is now fully server-side like all other settings; `localStorage` retains only a pre-render hint for the flash-prevention IIFE.
- **Cooking timer — no sound or speech on Android kiosk** — Three independent root causes fixed: (1) `AudioContext` was created fresh outside a user gesture, starting in `suspended` state and failing silently; a shared pre-unlocked context (`_sharedAudioCtx`) is now created during user gestures (`startCookingMode`, `addCookingTimer`). (2) The `_cookingTTS` gate (for step narration) was incorrectly blocking timer alarm speech — timer alerts now always speak regardless of that flag. (3) `_kioskBridge.speak()` (native Android TTS) was never considered as a fallback when `window.speechSynthesis` is absent in the WebView.
- **Scale use ignored for conf products** — `_scaleAutoFillUse()` returned early when `_activeUnit !== 'sub'`, but conf products default to `conf` mode. The function now auto-switches to sub mode before processing the weight reading. Scale button (`btnUse`) is also now visible for conf products that have a g/ml package unit.
- **Kiosk — native settings button reappearing unexpectedly** — `closeModal()` was calling `setNativeSettingsVisible(true)`, restoring the native Android settings button after every modal close. `_injectKioskOverlay()` now permanently hides the native button; scattered per-modal show/hide calls removed; a ⚙️ web button opens the in-app settings page.
- **SQLite database locked during inventory update** — `updateInventory()` made 3–4 separate write statements without a transaction; a concurrent cron job could acquire the write lock between them, causing a `database is locked` PDO error. All writes are now wrapped in `beginTransaction()`/`commit()`, with the Bring! HTTP sync deferred to after `commit()`. Closes [#109](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/109), [#110](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/110).
- **Depleted-item urgency incorrect** — Items with zero quantity were assigned urgency based on recency of use rather than consumption frequency. Urgency is now computed from `usesPerMonth` only, so frequently-used depleted items are correctly flagged as urgent.
- **0.5 conf use and decimal display** — Default mode on the use-quantity page is now conf for conf products; fraction buttons (½, ¼, ¾) work correctly; conf decimals are shown in the transaction history log.
- **Bring! health check token warning** — Token validity warning was shown even for valid tokens; health check is now restored with correct token-format detection.
- **Recipe quantities for conf+weight products** — Quantities are now calculated correctly when a conf product has a gram-based package unit.
- **Shopping settings not syncing across clients** — `shopping_*` keys were missing from `serverKeys` in `_applySyncedSettings`; shopping settings were client-local. All shopping keys now sync from server on load.

### Added
- **Native shopping list** — Built-in shopping list (no Bring! required) as an alternative mode (`SHOPPING_MODE=internal`). Resolves [#105](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/105).
- **Google Drive backup via localhost OAuth** — GDrive backup no longer requires a public domain; the OAuth redirect flow uses `http://localhost` via a temporary local server, compatible with self-hosted setups. Resolves [#107](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/107).

### Changed
- **All settings fully server-centralised** — Removed remaining `localStorage` usage for user preferences; all settings are now read from and written to `.env` via the API. Preferences are shared across all devices (desktop, phone, kiosk) automatically.

## [1.7.23] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- **⚙️ Generali tab** — new first tab in Settings groups all global settings: language, currency, theme, screensaver, zero-waste tips, inventory export. Old Language tab removed.
- **DB auto-cleanup** — `RECIPE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 7) and `TRANSACTION_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 7) added to `.env`; old rows are deleted automatically every cron cycle, followed by `VACUUM` to compact the database. Manual trigger: `GET /api/?action=db_cleanup`.
- **Vacuum-sealed expiry grace period** — `VACUUM_EXPIRY_EXTENSION_DAYS` (default 30): vacuum-sealed products are only flagged as expired N days *after* the printed date, preventing false alarms on long-lasting items like cured meats.
- **Gemini AI usage tracking** — monthly and yearly token/cost stats now shown in Settings → ℹ️ Info tab, using tracked data from `data/ai_usage.json`. Cost rates configurable via `GEMINI_COST_25F_IN/OUT` and `GEMINI_COST_20F_IN/OUT` in `.env`.

### Changed
- **Auto theme is now time-based** — "Automatico" mode switches to dark at 20:00 and back to light at 07:00, based on server/device clock (not OS preference). Re-evaluates every 5 minutes; ideal for always-on kiosk displays.
- **`dispensa.db` auto-deleted** — if the legacy empty `dispensa.db` file appears alongside `evershelf.db`, it is now removed automatically by the health check.
- **ZeroWaste tips and screensaver timeout** — these settings were not being persisted to `.env` on save (missing from POST payload); fixed.

## [1.7.22] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- **DB name corrected** — `health_check` now looks for `evershelf.db` (was wrongly looking for `dispensa.db`). Auto-migration included: if `evershelf.db` is missing but `dispensa.db` exists, it is renamed automatically on startup.
- **Removed legacy `data/dispensa.db`** — the old database file has been deleted; only `evershelf.db` is used.
- **Conditional checks** — Bring!, TTS, Scale and Internet checks only run when the respective feature is enabled in `.env` (no more false ❌/⚠️ for unconfigured features).
- **Backups check** — no longer checks if `data/backups/` is writable by www-data (cron writes as root). Now checks that backup files actually exist and the most recent one is recent.
- **Bring! token check** — reads `data/bring_token.json` file instead of looking for a non-existent `BRING_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var.

### Changed
- **Warning popup with 5s countdown** — when non-critical checks fail at startup, a styled popup appears showing each warning with its label and a plain-language hint explaining the problem. A countdown bar auto-closes the popup after 5 seconds, then the app starts normally.
- **Error blocking popup** — when critical checks fail, a clear blocking panel shows with title "Errore critico", each failed check listed with its explanation hint, and a Retry button. The app does not start.
- **`db_legacy` check added** — warns (optional) if the old `dispensa.db` file is still present alongside `evershelf.db`.
- **32 total checks** — added `db_legacy`, `tts_url`, `scale_gateway` to the check set (conditional).
- **Hint messages** — every check now has an Italian-language `hint` field explaining what is wrong and how to fix it.

## [1.7.21] - 2026-05-20

### Changed
- **Startup health check** — Complete redesign from a banner checklist to a **real-time progress bar**. The bar fills smoothly as each of 29 diagnostic checks runs, with the current check name shown below in real time. Warnings (⚠️) are displayed as amber badges that remain visible for 2 seconds before the app proceeds. Critical failures turn the bar red and show a detailed error block with a Retry button.
- **29 comprehensive checks**: PHP version, 8 PHP extensions (pdo_sqlite, curl, json, mbstring, openssl, fileinfo, zip, intl), PHP memory/timeout/upload config, data directory, rate_limits dir, backups dir, disk write test, free disk space, SQLite connection, required tables, integrity (PRAGMA quick_check), WAL mode, DB size, inventory row count, .env file, Gemini AI key, Bring! credentials, Bring! token, cURL SSL, internet reachability.
- Warnings now clearly visible: each non-critical failure shows as a named amber badge (e.g. "⚠️ Bring! token") that cannot be missed.

## [1.7.20] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Startup health check** — During the splash screen, the app now runs a comprehensive server-side diagnostic before loading: PHP version, required extensions (pdo_sqlite, curl, mbstring, json), `data/` directory writability, SQLite database connection and table integrity, `.env` file presence, Gemini AI key and Bring! token. Results are displayed as an animated checklist (✅ / ⚠️ / ❌). Critical failures (DB, extensions, data dir) block the app with a clear error message and a "Retry" button — the app never starts silently broken. Non-critical warnings (missing Gemini key, Bring! token) are shown as amber items but do not block startup.
- New `?action=health_check` PHP endpoint (early-exit, no rate-limit, no auth).
- New translation keys `startup.*` in all 5 languages (IT, EN, DE, FR, ES).

## [1.7.19] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **Zero-waste tips during cooking** — When cooking mode is active, a ♻️ card appears below each step that generates reusable scraps (peels, cooking water, egg whites, cheese rinds, bread crusts, vegetable tops, etc.). Gemini generates the tips as part of the recipe JSON at no extra API cost. Tips are dismissible per-step and reset on recipe restart. Opt-in toggle in Settings → Zero-waste tips (default OFF). Resolves [#76](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/76).
- New translation keys `cooking.zerowaste_*` and `settings.zerowaste.*` in all 5 languages (IT, EN, DE, FR, ES).

## [1.7.18] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **Dark mode** — New theme selector in Settings (Appearance card): **Off (Light)**, **On (Dark)**, **Auto (follows system)**. Applied immediately on page load to prevent white flash. Resolves [#78](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/78).
- **Export inventory** — New 📤 button in inventory page header opens a modal to download the inventory as **CSV** (UTF-8 with BOM, Excel-compatible) or open a **print-ready HTML page** (auto-triggers print dialog for PDF). Export card also available in Settings tab. Resolves [#64](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/64).
- `translations/de.json`: fixed missing `log.recipe_prefix` key.

## [1.7.17] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **French translation (🇫🇷 Français)** — Complete `translations/fr.json` with all 1049 translation keys. Resolves [#77](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/77).
- **Spanish translation (🇪🇸 Español)** — Complete `translations/es.json` with all 1049 translation keys. Resolves [#77](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/77).
- Language selector in Settings now shows all 5 languages: 🇮🇹 Italiano, 🇬🇧 English, 🇩🇪 Deutsch, 🇫🇷 Français, 🇪🇸 Español.
- Default fallback language changed from Italian to English (for users with unsupported browser locale).
- Setup wizard "Done" screen and navigation buttons localised for French and Spanish.

## [1.7.16] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Barcode scan history** — Last 20 scanned products are stored server-side (SQLite `app_settings`) and shown as chips in the scan page (`#scan-recents-chips`). Tapping a chip selects the product directly — no need to scan again. Resolves [#68](https://github.com/dadaloop82/EverShelf/issues/68).
- **Full server-side user-data centralisation** — All user preferences previously siloed in `localStorage` per-device are now synced to the server via `app_settings_save` and loaded back at startup via `app_settings_get`. Affected data: shopping tags, pinned Bring! items, location preferences (use/move), auto-added Bring! entries, Bring! purchased blocklist, no-expiry dismissed products. Data is now shared across all devices (desktop, phone, kiosk, Android app).
- **One-time localStorage migration** — On first load, any data found in the old localStorage keys (`shopping_tags`, `_userPinnedBring`, `_prefUseLoc`, `_prefMoveLoc`, `_autoAddedBring`, `_bringPurchasedBlocklist`, `_noExpiryDismissed`, `evershelf_scan_recents`) is automatically migrated to the server and the local keys are removed.

## [1.7.15] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Full i18n audit** — Comprehensive sweep of all user-visible strings in `app.js` and `index.html`. 25+ new translation keys added across `it.json`, `en.json`, `de.json`, covering: vacuum toast, TTS voice controls, timer step labels, product note labels, error messages, expiry form, barcode hint, category select placeholder, cooking step fallback, `form.select_placeholder`, `btn.yes_short`/`no_short`, `add.vacuum_question`, `add.vacuum_saved`, `move.vacuum_seal_rest`, `cooking.step_fallback`, `error.prefix`/`unknown`, `product.select_variant`, and more.
- **Splash screen redesign** — Logo displayed prominently, spinner below, app version shown at the bottom; version label injected dynamically at boot time so it never gets out of sync. Minimum 3-second display duration enforced: `_splashStart` is recorded before `DOMContentLoaded`; the fade-out is delayed by the remaining time if the app loads faster than 3 s.
- **Demo GIF in README** — `assets/img/demo.gif` (processed at 2× speed, ~36 s) added to the `## 📸 Screenshots` section.
- **`pz`/`conf` unit labels translated** — "pz" now shows as "pcs" in English and "Stk" in German; "conf" shows as "pkg" / "Pkg". All `unitLabels` objects in JS now use `t('units.pz')` / `t('units.conf')`.

### Fixed
- **Camera button (📷) opened kiosk SettingsActivity on Android** — The native `btnSettings` ImageButton in the kiosk layout was positioned `top|end` with `alpha=0.12` (nearly invisible), sitting directly on top of the HTML scan button in the webapp header. Every tap on the 📷 button was intercepted by the native View and opened `SettingsActivity`. Fixed: moved `btnSettings` to `bottom|end` (above the bottom nav bar, `marginBottom=80dp`) and increased `alpha` to `0.28` so it is clearly separate from the header. Kiosk versionCode bumped to 16.
- **Camera button (📷) opened settings on Android Chrome/Brave** — `pointerleave` fired before `pointerup` when finger drifted slightly, cancelling the long-press timer and leaving the browser to dispatch a synthetic `click` that bubbled to an unintended handler. Fixed: added `setPointerCapture` (prevents `pointerleave` during touch) and `preventDefault` (blocks synthetic click); replaced `pointerleave` with `pointercancel` handler. Added `touch-action: manipulation` to `.header-scan-btn` CSS.
- **Logo white background on splash screen** — Re-processed both `logo.png` and `logo_icon.png` with fuzz 35% alpha extraction, removing the white background that was visible against the dark splash background (`#0f172a`).
- **Recipe button label** — Shortened to "Ricetta" / "Recipe" / "Rezept" for compact display in the inventory quick-action modal.
- **Quantity decimal precision** — `qtyNum` in recipe/cooking ingredient buttons and `conf` fallback display in inventory cards now limited to 1 decimal place (was showing 7+ decimal places from raw AI output, e.g. `0.25353223 conf`).
- **"Errore" / "Error" fallback strings** — All remaining Italian hardcoded `'Errore'` fallbacks in `showToast()` calls replaced with `t('error.generic')`. Italian fallback strings removed from buttons that already used `t()`.
- **README Italian phrases** — "La quantità è giusta (2 pz)", "🤖 Spiega", "Latte / Affettato / Panna da cucina", "Buon appetito!", "L'ho buttato" replaced with English equivalents in the README.
- **Appliance chips translated** — `renderAppliances()` now shows translated names (e.g. "Air fryer" in EN, "Heißluftfritteuse" in DE) for all known canonical Italian appliance names via `_applianceDisplayName()` lookup. `addApplianceQuick` toast no longer hardcoded Italian. Remove-button title translated.
- **Gemini API key not preserved on settings save** — `saveSettings()` was overwriting `s.gemini_key = ""` when the Gemini input field was empty (it is intentionally not pre-populated for security). Key is now preserved if the input is blank. `_geminiAvailable` is re-fetched from the server after every settings save so the recipe buttons reflect the real state immediately.

## [1.7.14] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **In-app bug report form** — "Segnala un problema" now opens a modal form instead of redirecting to GitHub. Users can select type (Bug / Feature / Question), write title and description, optionally add reproduction steps. A GitHub issue is created directly with labels and app metadata attached.

### Fixed
- **Kiosk settings button** — "Apri configurazione kiosk" in webapp settings was showing a toast asking to tap a gear icon that no longer exists. Now calls `openNativeSettings()` bridge directly (opens Android SettingsActivity). Fallback for old APKs shows a proper "update the kiosk app" hint.
- **False update badge** — `manifest.json` version was `1.7.12` while the app header showed `v1.7.13`, causing the server to report an older deployed version and triggering a spurious update notification.
- **Kiosk settings gear disappeared** — Race condition where Kotlin's `onPageFinished` injects `#_kiosk_overlay` before JS runs; JS found the element already present and returned early without ever restoring the native gear button. Fixed: JS no longer hides the native gear on load; `closeModal()` restores it with `setNativeSettingsVisible(true)`.
- **`openNativeSettings()` fragile typeof check** — Android `@JavascriptInterface` methods are not always detected as `'function'` by typeof; replaced with try/catch.

## [1.7.13] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **Fresh-install crash: `no such column: undone`** — The `transactions` table was created in `initializeDB()` without the `undone` column, but the composite index `idx_transactions_pid_type_undone` immediately referenced it, crashing every new installation at first DB access.  Added `undone INTEGER DEFAULT 0` to the transactions schema in `initializeDB()`.
- **Race condition: `duplicate column name: package_unit`** — Concurrent API requests on a new installation could all pass the `PRAGMA table_info` guard simultaneously and each try to `ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN package_unit`, with all but the first failing with a PDOException.  Wrapped all `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` calls in try/catch to silently ignore duplicate-column errors.

## [1.7.12] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- **"Use first" banner showed a calculated expiry date** — `_renderUseExpiryHint` was displaying a *calculated* shelf-life date (from opening date) instead of the actual one. When `opened_at` is set, the banner now shows "That one [in the fridge], opened X days ago — use it first!" using the new `use.expiry_warning_opened` translation key.
- **"Use All / Done" in recipes deleted the inventory row** — `submitRecipeUse(true)` was sending `use_all: true` to the API, which executed a direct `DELETE` on the inventory row without any confirmation. The function now calculates the exact quantity from the available items (`_recipeUseContext.items`) and sends a regular `inventory_use` with an explicit quantity.
- **Recipes: `qty_number` returned in grams for piece-counted (`pz`) items** — The AI prompt and PHP post-processing now instruct Gemini to express `qty_number` as whole pieces for ingredients with unit `pz` (sliced bread, crackers, etc.). The ingredient list in the prompt includes `[use whole PIECES]` for each `pz` product. The PHP fallback for `pz` items without `default_quantity` no longer divides by 100, but uses the AI-returned `qty_number` if it is a plausible count, otherwise defaults to 1.

### Added
- **Translation key `use.expiry_warning_opened`** — New key in `it.json`, `en.json`, `de.json` with `{loc}` (location) and `{when}` (days since opening) placeholders.

## [1.7.11] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Scan page redesign** — The scanner page has been completely redesigned for tablet and mobile:
  - **2× fixed zoom** — hardware zoom if available, otherwise automatic CSS `scale(2)`.
  - **Torch** — in-viewport button with toast feedback and visual state indicator.
  - **Camera flip** — front/back switch with persistence in settings.
  - **3 input tabs** — Barcode / Name / AI for quick access to each scanning mode.
  - **Recent products** — chips for the last 6 scanned products (localStorage), with category icon.
  - **Live code overlay** — partially detected barcode shown as overlay in the viewport during partial scan.
  - **Confirm overlay** — checkmark + product name displayed for 900 ms on successful recognition.
  - **Guide corners** — visual alignment frame for barcode centering.
  - **AI Number OCR** — after 4 s without a scan, a "Read numbers with AI" button appears; Gemini analyses the video frame and returns barcode digits even when the optical scanner fails.
- **PHP `gemini_number_ocr` endpoint** — New POST endpoint; accepts a base64 JPEG image, asks Gemini to locate the EAN-13 / EAN-8 code printed on the product, and returns the digits or `not_found`.

### Fixed
- **False consumption anomaly positives (e.g. "Mozzarella 3 pcs")** — Removed the `untracked` direction (consumption higher than recorded purchases), which was generating banners for every product with untracked purchase history. Only `phantom` and `missing` anomalies are now reported.
- **"~0 g/week" consumption prediction** — The model now requires a minimum of 5 transactions (was 3) and a time span of at least 7 days; predictions where consumption is < 15% of the baseline are skipped, eliminating false positives for products with few closely-spaced transactions.
- **Suggestion dropdown on the Name field (scan page)** — Removed `list="common-products"` from the input field; the datalist is no longer triggered on tablets.

## [1.7.10] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- **"Set expiry" banner did nothing** — `editBannerNoExpiry()` was calling `openEditInventoryModal()` which does not exist. Fixed to call `editInventoryItem()` (the correct function used by all other banner handlers). Added a prefetch of `inventory_list` because `currentInventory` is empty on the dashboard.
- **"Product not found" when opening modal from a banner** — `currentInventory` is always empty on the dashboard; the inventory fetch now happens before opening the modal (same pattern as `editReviewItem` and `weighBannerItem`).
- **Expired banner on opened UHT milk** — The banner was showing "Expired!" instead of "Opened too long". Items with `opened_at` now display "Opened X days ago in [location]" in both the title and the banner detail.
- **Generic milk shelf life 4 → 7 days** — Milk without qualifiers (e.g. "Milk") was treated as fresh (4 days). Fresh milk is still handled explicitly (`latte fresco/intero/parzial/scremato` → 3 days); the generic case now defaults to 7 days (UHT default). Fix applied in both PHP (`database.php`) and JS (`app.js`).
- **Stale `opened_at` on sealed packages after split** — When a use operation splits a row into "whole sealed packages + opened fraction", the sealed-packages row was not clearing `opened_at`. All 3 split code paths now execute `opened_at = NULL` on the sealed row.
- **`inventory_update` was not recording transactions** — The quantity-edit modal updated inventory without creating transaction records. The quantity difference is now automatically recorded as `in` or `out` with a `[Manual correction]` note, preventing false positives in the anomaly detector.
- **False consumption anomalies after restocking** — The prediction baseline was using only the restock quantity (`restockQty`), ignoring pre-existing stock, causing `actual > expected` systematically. New baseline: `current_qty + consumed_since_last_restock`, which correctly reflects the real situation regardless of prior stock levels.
- **Anomaly banner firing on almost all products** — Two fixes:
  1. `expected = 0` no longer generates a "more" anomaly (the model assumed you should have run out, but you restocked).
  2. "More than expected" threshold raised to 400% (was 30%); "less than expected" threshold remains at 30%.
- **Expired section showing already-discarded products** — The `expired` query was missing `AND i.quantity > 0`; discarded products (qty=0) with a past expiry kept appearing. Query fixed and orphan rows cleaned from the DB.
- **Hardcoded Italian string `scade il` in banner** — Replaced with the correct i18n key.
- **Docker: `SQLSTATE[HY000][14] unable to open database file`** — `_ensureDataDir()` in `database.php` now creates the `data/` directory if missing and attempts `chmod(0775)` if not writable, resolving the error on freshly mounted Docker volumes.

### Added
- **Complete i18n** — Added ~25 missing translation keys for kiosk UI, Gemini responses, banners, scanner, shopping, and appliances across all 3 language files (`it.json`, `en.json`, `de.json`). Total: 934 keys per language.

## [1.7.8] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Transfer to Recipes from chat** — When the Gemini Chef chat generates a recipe, a "📥 Transfer to Recipes" button appears. Pressing it triggers Gemini to convert the chat text into a complete structured JSON (title, meal, ingredients, steps); the backend enriches each ingredient with `product_id` and `location` via fuzzy-match (identical to `generateRecipe`); the recipe is saved and opens directly in the Recipes section with all "Use" buttons and full cooking mode.
- **"Open recipe" button** — After a successful transfer, the "📥 Transfer to Recipes" button transforms into "📖 Open recipe" (same DOM element), preventing overlap.
- **Create a recipe from an ingredient** — In the action panel of every inventory item, a "👨‍🍳 Create a recipe with this" button appears (teal, full width). Pressing it, Gemini generates a recipe using that ingredient as the star (same pipeline as `chatToRecipe`: inventory fuzzy-match enrichment, `meal=null`, 8192 token max).
- **Meal not auto-categorized** — Recipes generated from chat or from an ingredient are no longer auto-categorized (`meal` remains null); the meal tag in the UI is only shown when explicitly set.

### Fixed
- **Smart shopping: false "running low" alert** — If a product in grams/ml was nearly exhausted (e.g. Butter 30 g = 12%) but the same product was also available as a sealed package (Butter 1 pack = 99%), the system still flagged "running low". Now checks whether the `shopping_name` family has stock from other products; if so, the alert is suppressed.
- **Corrupted translation JSON** — The `action` section was duplicated in `de.json`, `en.json`, and `it.json`, causing JSON parse errors that blocked CI/CD. The spurious duplicate section has been removed.

## [1.7.7] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **Smart shopping family suppression** — The `recentlyExhausted` logic (products finished < 14 days ago) was incorrectly bypassing the `shopping_name` family suppression, causing false positives: products like Vanilla Yogurt appeared urgent even with 2 kg of Yogurt in stock. `recentlyExhausted` now only bypasses the token-based loose match; family suppression by `shopping_name` always applies.
- **Shelf-life pre-warming in cron** — The cron now calls `prewarmShelfLifeCache()` every 5 minutes, pre-loading via Gemini AI the shelf life of opened inventory items (max 5 items per cycle) before the user views them. This eliminates the noticeable delay on first click of "Opened on…".

## [1.7.6] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **`shopping_name` truncated (Piadina)** — The product "Piadine medie" had `shopping_name='Pi'` (truncated), preventing it from grouping correctly in its family. Fixed to `Piadina`.
- **Family merges in DB** — Grana Padano now under `Formaggio` (was a `Grana` singleton), Prosciutto cotto now under `Affettato`, Panna acida now under `Panna`.
- **`daily_rate` over the actual active period** — The daily consumption rate was using `first_in → now` as the window, diluting the rate with periods when the product was already exhausted (e.g. garlic exhausted at day 34 was calculated over 60+ days). Now uses `first_in → last_activity` (last purchase or last use), giving more accurate reorder predictions.
- **Stable anomaly dismiss key** — The dismiss key was using `product_id + round(expected)`, which changed with every new transaction, causing already-dismissed anomalies to reappear. Now uses `product_id + direction` (phantom/missing/untracked) — stable as long as the direction does not change.
- **Smart shopping: products exhausted < 14 days ago** — Products finished within the last 14 days are no longer suppressed by the token-coverage check or the shopping_name family check: if you just ran out, you probably want to restock regardless of equivalent stock on hand.
- **Chat pruning** — `chatSave()` now deletes messages beyond the 200 most recent after each save, preventing unbounded growth of the `chat_messages` table.


## [1.7.5] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Vacuum sealed prompt on item use** — After using a conf/weighted-unit item that still has remaining stock, a sliding popup asks "🔒 Messo sotto vuoto?" with Sì/No buttons and an 8-second auto-dismiss countdown bar. Default is Sì if the item was previously sealed, No otherwise. Works for all container units (conf, g, kg, ml, l) and any item previously marked as vacuum sealed.
- **Multi-function appliance awareness in recipes** — When the user sets a multi-function appliance (Cookeo, Bimby, Thermomix, Monsieur Cuisine, Instant Pot, Multicooker, Robot da cucina) in Settings, all Gemini recipe prompts (chat, recipe generation, weekly meal plan) now explicitly instruct the AI to consolidate as many cooking steps as possible into that single machine. Each appliance's available functions (rosolare, tritare, vapore, cuocere a pressione, etc.) are listed and the AI is required to indicate the specific mode/program at each step.
- **Server-side Bring! cleanup in cron** — `bringCleanupObsolete()` now runs every 5 minutes via cron without requiring any client page load. Items auto-added by the app (identified by `⚡`/`🟠`/`🛒` markers in their Bring! spec) are automatically removed when the smart shopping engine no longer flags them as needed. Works across all devices/clients.
- **`shopping_name` in `inventory_list` API** — The `inventory_list` endpoint now returns the `shopping_name` field from the products table, enabling family-based stock matching in the client-side cleanup fallback.

### Fixed
- **Bring! cleanup: false token match (Succo/Frutta)** — `bringCleanupObsolete` previously indexed smart items by product name tokens. "Pera Italiana **Succo** e polpa **frutta**" (shopping_name: "Pere") caused "Succo" and "Frutta" to be retained on Bring! indefinitely even when fully stocked. Now indexes **only** by `shopping_name` tokens.
- **Bring! cleanup: expired items with fresh family stock (Verdure)** — When a product is expired but its `shopping_name` family has ≥50% fresh stock from other products (e.g. Minestrone tradizione scaduto 01/05 but 590g fresh Verdure in freezer/pantry), it is no longer flagged as `critical` and is removed from the shopping list.
- **Bring! remove: catalog items not removed (Formaggio/Käse)** — `bringRemoveItem()` and `bringCleanupObsolete()` now try both the Italian display name and the Bring! internal German catalog key (e.g. `Käse` for `Formaggio`). Previously, catalog items with a German key were silently not removed.
- **Barcode scanner: EAN auto-submit on manual input** — Typing or pasting a valid 8/13-digit EAN in the manual barcode field now auto-submits immediately without needing to press a button. Checksum validation gives a warning toast for invalid codes without blocking entry.
- **Shopping list: `isExpiringSoon` false positives** — Products bought in bulk that expire naturally in 3 days (e.g. fresh produce) were flagged `medium` urgency on the shopping list despite having 100%+ stock. Now requires `pctLeft < 50%` before triggering.
- **Shopping list: expired batch with fresh restock suppressed** — Products with an expired batch AND a recent fresh restock (≥50% fresh stock) are no longer flagged `critical` for shopping. The expired-batch UI banner on the dashboard handles the disposal prompt instead.
- **Shopping list: cross-device cleanup** — Client-side `cleanupObsoleteBringItems()` now detects app-added items by their spec markers (`⚡`/`🟠`/`🛒`) instead of a per-device localStorage map, making cleanup work correctly on all clients including newly logged-in devices. Throttle reduced from 30 minutes to 3 minutes.
- **API fetch caching disabled** — All `api()` calls in the frontend now set `cache: 'no-store'` to prevent stale data from browser cache.
- **Shopping page multi-client sync** — Added 45-second polling on the shopping page so changes made on another device are reflected automatically.



### Added
- **AI price estimation for shopping list** — Each item on the Bring! shopping list now shows an estimated retail price badge (per unit and total). Prices are fetched from Gemini AI and cached server-side for 3 months (`PRICE_UPDATE_MONTHS`). The running estimated total is displayed both in the shopping tab and as a green pill badge on the dashboard stat card.
- **Dashboard price total badge** — The shopping stat card on the dashboard shows a green `ca. €X.XX` badge (top-right, same position as the old urgency badge). It updates in real-time as prices are calculated and persists across navigation via `sessionStorage`.
- **Background price refresh** — Prices are fetched silently every 2 minutes even when not on the shopping tab, keeping the dashboard badge current without user interaction.
- **Smart quantity estimation** — The price payload uses `smart_shopping` data (consumption patterns) to send the correct buy quantity per item; falls back to Bring! spec parsing, then to `qty=1, unit=conf` for manually-added items.

### Fixed
- **`stat-price-total` not visible on dashboard** — The total was only computed when `shoppingItems` was populated (i.e. shopping tab had been visited). Now uses `sessionStorage._pricetotal` as fallback so the badge is visible immediately on any page.
- **Price bar reloading on every tab switch** — `renderShoppingItems` now checks if ALL items are already cached with matching qty/unit; if so, it applies prices from cache instantly with no loading bar or API call.
- **`stat-price-total` real-time update** — Dashboard stat now increments as each individual item is priced (not only after the entire fetch completes).
- **Broken emoji in `log.title`** — Corrupted `\uFFFD` character in `it.json` and `de.json` replaced with `📒`.
- **`PRICE_CACHE_PATH` undefined crash** — Server-side constant was used inside functions that were called before the define; moved define to the very top of `api/index.php` (line 19). Affected: all `get_shopping_price` and `get_all_shopping_prices` calls from 16:33–16:40 on 2026-05-07.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Destructive actions now require confirmation** — "Butta tutto" (`throwAll`) and "Finisci tutto" (`submitUseAll`) now display a confirmation modal before executing. The modal features a 5-second auto-confirm countdown bar (red) with an "Annulla" cancel button, matching the scale auto-confirm UX pattern already in use.
- **History undo button visibility** — The ↩ undo button in the transaction log was using `color: var(--text-muted)` making it nearly invisible. It now uses a red tint background + border (`#f87171`) with larger font size (1rem) for easy tap targeting.
- **History undo uses custom modal** — `undoTransactionEntry()` previously used the native browser `confirm()` dialog (broken in Android WebView kiosk mode). It now uses the same `_showDestructiveConfirm()` modal with countdown.



### Added
- **Demo mode (JS frontend)** — Full client-side demo experience: Gemini is treated as available, Bring! write operations silently no-op, and a mock pantry + shopping list is shown; activated via `?demo=1` URL param or `.env` `DEMO_MODE=true`; a "DEMO" badge is injected in the header and Settings is hidden to prevent accidental writes
- **Graceful Bring! no-key state** — When Bring! credentials are not configured the shopping tab shows a friendly localised message with a direct link to the Settings page instead of a raw API error
- **Use-quantity guard** — Consuming more than the quantity stocked at the selected location is now blocked before the API call; the quantity input shakes (CSS `input-shake` animation) and a toast shows `use.error_exceeds_stock`
- **Kiosk: smart auto-discovery rewrite** — `autoDiscover()` now uses `ExecutorCompletionService` + `NetworkInterface` (replaces deprecated `WifiManager`), 60 parallel threads, 600 ms TCP pre-check per host, real-time UI feedback every 120 ms, ports `[443, 80, 8080, 8443]`; VPN/cellular interfaces (tun, ppp, rmnet, pdp, ccmni, etc.) are filtered out and `wlan*`/`eth*` interfaces are prioritised
- **Kiosk: permissions button transform** — After permissions are granted, the button changes to "✅ Permessi concessi — Continua →" (green background, dark text) and advances to step 3 on tap, replacing the separate "permissions granted" card
- **Kiosk: gateway auto-pre-configuration** — On successful gateway install `finishSetup()` POSTs `scale_enabled=true` + `scale_gateway_url=ws://127.0.0.1:8765` to the server's `save_settings` endpoint so the webapp is scale-ready immediately after setup
- **Kiosk: ErrorReporter init at setup start** — `SetupActivity.onCreate()` now calls `ErrorReporter.init()` with any previously saved URL, ensuring errors in step 4 (gateway install) are reported even before the user confirms the server URL

### Fixed
- **Kiosk: wrong subnet scanned** — The previous implementation picked up VPN/tun interfaces and scanned a 10.x.x.x range instead of the device's actual Wi-Fi LAN; fixed by filtering interface names and preferring `wlan`/`eth`
- **Kiosk: port 443 missing from discovery** — HTTPS servers were never reachable during auto-discovery; ports list extended to `[443, 80, 8080, 8443]`
- **Kiosk: gateway install status=1 silent failure** — `PackageInstaller.STATUS_FAILURE` (status 1) showed an error card but never called `ErrorReporter`; `ErrorReporter.reportMessage()` is now called with status code, message, and package name
- **Screensaver toggle in web settings** — The screensaver row was missing a `<span class="toggle-slider">` inside the `<span class="toggle-switch">` wrapper, so no slider was rendered; corrected to use the same `toggle-row` / `toggle-switch` / `toggle-slider` structure as all other settings toggles
- **antiwaste.title translation** — IT and DE locale files were missing the `antiwaste.title` key, causing a raw key string to appear in the anti-waste section header; added to both `it.json` and `de.json`

### Kiosk (v1.4.0 → v1.5.0)
- `autoDiscover()` fully rewritten (CompletionService, NetworkInterface, TCP pre-check, real-time feedback, correct LAN subnet)
- Port 443 added to discovery scan
- Permissions button transforms after grant (`onPermissionsGranted()`)
- `ErrorReporter.init()` called at `SetupActivity.onCreate()`
- `ErrorReporter.reportMessage()` called on gateway install failure
- `finishSetup()` pre-configures gateway via `save_settings` API call

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Dashboard skeleton loading** — Stat cards (Dispensa / Frigo / Freezer) show an animated shimmer placeholder (`…`) instead of the jarring `0` flash that appeared for 3–5 seconds before data loaded; the loading class is applied before the API call and removed atomically when data arrives
- **Webapp startup preloader** — Full-screen spinner overlay during initial app load, fades out after the dashboard is ready
- **Webapp update notification** — A dismissible top banner alerts the user when a newer GitHub release is available (checked once every 6 hours, comparison based on `published_at`)
- **Native Android update banners** — Both Kiosk (v1.4.0) and Scale Gateway (v2.1.0) show a native top bar when a newer APK is available, with one-tap download and install

### Fixed
- **APK install conflict** — Replaced `ACTION_VIEW`-based APK install with the `PackageInstaller.Session` API (API 21+) in both Kiosk and Scale Gateway; the session-based approach correctly handles:
  - `STATUS_PENDING_USER_ACTION` → automatically launches the system confirmation dialog
  - `STATUS_SUCCESS` → success toast
  - `STATUS_FAILURE_CONFLICT` / `STATUS_FAILURE_INCOMPATIBLE` → `AlertDialog` offering to uninstall the old app (signature mismatch) before reinstalling
- **Cooking mode z-index** — Update banner and app header are now hidden when `body.cooking-mode-active` is set, and the cooking overlay z-index was raised to `99998` so it can no longer be obscured by UI chrome
- **Version-aware error reporting** — GitHub Issues are only created when the client is running the latest released version, avoiding noise from stale deployments; non-semver tag names (e.g. `"latest"`) are treated as "always up-to-date"
- **XOR-obfuscated GitHub token** — The PAT used for GitHub API calls is stored as an XOR-encoded hex string in both the PHP backend and Kotlin apps to prevent accidental exposure via secret scanning

### Kiosk (v1.3.0 → v1.4.0)
- FileProvider + `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` permission added
- APK download destination moved to `getExternalFilesDir(null)` (no storage permission needed)
- `PackageInstaller` self-update with signature-conflict recovery
- BLE scale gateway update banner with download + install flow

### Scale Gateway (v2.0.0 → v2.1.0)
- Same FileProvider + permission + `PackageInstaller` changes as Kiosk
- Update banner for self-update
- CI workflow now triggers on `develop` branch (in addition to `main`)

## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Low-qty banner false positive** — A "suspiciously low quantity" review alert is now suppressed for a partially-used inventory entry when one or more sibling entries for the same product (identified by barcode, or name+brand as fallback) exist in other locations with stock > 0. Prevents noise like "191 ml of milk" when 11 sealed packages are stored in the pantry.

### Changed
- **Non-alarmist expired banner** — Banner icon, CSS class, and title suffix now adapt to the `getExpiredSafety()` level:
  - `ok` (long-life products, freezer within margin): green banner, ✅ icon, "— Scaduto (ancora ok)"
  - `warning` (items that should be inspected): amber/yellow banner, 👀 icon, "— Scaduto (controlla)"
  - `danger` (raw meat, dairy, fish, etc.): unchanged red 🚫 banner and "— Scaduto!" title
- Added `expiry.expired_suffix_ok` and `expiry.expired_suffix_warning` i18n keys to all three language files (IT/EN/DE)
- Added `banner-expired-ok` and `banner-expired-warning` CSS variants (green / amber) in `style.css`

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Expired banner for opened products** — Products whose opened-product shelf-life has passed (e.g. fridge cream opened 6 days ago) now appear in the top notification banner, not just the dashboard list
- **Safety-aware expired banner** — Each expired banner item shows a contextual safety tip (from `getExpiredSafety()`); danger-level items (fridge dairy/meat/fish) get an intense red banner and "L'ho buttato" as the primary button; safe/warning items keep the original button order
- **AI model fallback** — All Gemini API endpoints (expiry scan, product identification, chat, recipe non-streaming, shopping name classifier) now try `gemini-2.5-flash` first and fall back to `gemini-2.0-flash` automatically, matching the resilience already in place for recipe streaming
- **Friendly AI quota message** — When the AI returns a quota/rate-limit error the user sees "Quota AI esaurita. Riprova tra qualche minuto." instead of the raw API error string
- **Cooking TTS auto-read** — Each recipe step is read aloud automatically when navigating forward or backward; the first step is also read when entering cooking mode
- **Cooking timer 10-second warning** — When a cooking timer reaches 10 seconds the TTS announces "Attenzione! [label]: mancano 10 secondi!"
- **Cooking recipe completion announcement** — "Ricetta completata! Buon appetito!" is spoken via TTS when the last step is confirmed

### Fixed
- **Cooking TTS gate** — `speakCookingStep()` was blocked by the global `tts_enabled` setting; the `_cookingTTS` toggle (🔊/🔇 button) is now the only gate; browser Web Speech API is used by default without requiring TTS configuration in Settings
- **Anomaly dismiss label** — The "La quantità è giusta" button now appends the current inventory quantity, e.g. "La quantità è giusta (2 pz)", so the action is unambiguous
- **i18n sync** — Added `timer_warning_tts`, `recipe_done_tts`, `error.ai_quota` keys to all three language files (IT/EN/DE)


### Added
- **Generic shopping names** — Products are grouped by type ("Latte", "Affettato", "Pasta") rather than brand; computed via an expanded keyword map with Google Gemini AI as fallback for unknown products
- **Bring! auto-migration** — Existing list items with old specific names are silently migrated to generic names on every list load, throttled to once per 10 minutes
- **Bring! catalog coverage** — All 93 shopping_name values now resolve to a German Bring! catalog key (icons and categories in the Bring! app); 24 aliases added to cover previously unmatched names
- **Auto-add to Bring! on depletion** — When a product reaches zero the app adds it to Bring! automatically using the generic shopping name, with the specific product name and brand in the specification field
- **Finished-product confirmation banner** — Instead of silently deleting zero-stock entries, a banner prompts the user to confirm; banner title includes the last 3 digits of the product barcode for easier identification
- **Anomaly detection banner** — Dashboard notifications for suspicious inventory/transaction mismatches and consumption prediction errors, with one-tap inline correction
- **SSE recipe streaming** — Recipe generation streams live via Server-Sent Events; Gemini agent feedback is shown in real time as it is generated
- **Smart alert banners** — Configurable expired-only mode with explanatory messages; banner buttons are fully internationalized

### Fixed
- **Scale double-deduction** — Multiple BLE stable readings of the same weight no longer fire duplicate `inventory_use` events; JS preserves the confirmation sentinel on submit and PHP rejects a second `out` transaction for the same product within 12 seconds
- **Kiosk native TTS** — CI workflow now builds the APK on `develop` branch too; the native Android `TextToSpeech` bridge bypasses Web Speech API voice-availability issues without requiring offline voice packs
- **TTS voice loading** — Retries for up to 10 seconds on page load; shows a message if no voices are available and offers a manual refresh button
- **Bring! migration** — Corrected two bugs: wrong removal API (`DELETE /item` → `PUT remove=item`) and wrong purchase key sent to Bring! (Italian shopping name → German catalog key), which previously created Italian/German duplicate entries
- **Gemini 429 rate limiting** — API calls are retried with exponential backoff; recipe requests are capped at 5 per minute with a dedicated rate-limit bucket

### Performance
- **Gemini calls centralized** — All Gemini API requests go through a single `callGemini()` helper with intelligent backoff; Gemini removed from the product-selection and bringSuggest flows in favour of fast offline logic

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Expired product banner** — Dashboard notifications for expired products with use, throw away, edit, and dismiss actions
- **Expiring soon banner** — Dashboard notifications for products expiring within 3 days with use, edit, and dismiss actions
- **Priority-sorted notifications** — Banner alerts sorted by urgency: expired > expiring > suspicious quantities > consumption predictions
- **Swipe navigation** — Touch swipe left/right to browse banner notifications, with dot indicators and arrow buttons
- **Quick-access buttons** — Inventory page shows 4 recently used and up to 8 most popular products for quick selection
- **Recent & popular products API** — New `recent_popular_products` endpoint
- **Auto-refresh** — Banner notifications refresh every 5 minutes while on the dashboard
- **Edit from expiry banner** — Correct expiry dates directly from expired/expiring notifications

### Fixed
- **Negative scale values** — BLE scale readings with negative weight are now ignored
- **Banner re-appearing after edit** — Editing from a banner now persists the confirmation so it doesn't reappear on dashboard reload
- **False consumption predictions** — Manual inventory edits (updated_at > last restock) now use the correct baseline for prediction calculations
- **Kiosk overlay blocking header** — Removed injected exit/refresh buttons from the web app header in kiosk mode
